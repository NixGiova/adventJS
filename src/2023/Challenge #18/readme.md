# Challenge #18: ðŸ”¢ The digital clock

In the toy factory, **the elves are programming a digital clock** to keep them on schedule with gift production. However, they have encountered an interesting programming challenge. They need a function that, given a time in 'HH:MM' format, creates a visual representation of this time on a digital clock by returning **an array of arrays of characters.**

**The clock screen has 7 rows and 17 columns**, and each digit of the time takes up 7 rows and 3 columns. The digits are composed of asterisks `(*)` and blank spaces (` `). There is an empty column between each digit.

**The colon separating hours and minutes** is drawn using two asterisks `(*)` and is always placed in the same position, in rows 2 and 4, in column 9, respectively (note: row and column indexing starts at 0).

For example, if the function receives `01:30`, it should return:

```

```

To know how to draw each digit, we have been given the following image. As you can see, **each digit is composed of 7 rows and 3 columns**. We will represent the pixels in red with an asterisk `(*)`, and the white pixels with a space (` `):
